Although I said in the previous journal entry which I shared to my social media profiles that I would be taking a hiatus for approximately three weeks from making any updates to either to the public karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com or else to the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com or else to any public karbytes-created GitHub repositories which are partitioned under the portion of GitHub dot Com which is allocated to the user account whose username is @karlinarayberinger (starting between the midnight on 02_FEBRUARY_2024 and midnight on 04_FEBRUARY_2024), I decided within the past 48 hours of writing this note between 6PM Pacific Standard Time and 8PM Pacific Standard Time on 06_FEBRUARY_2024 to make a few more updates to that body of (public domain) intellectual property which I refer to within that intellectual property and elsewhere as karbytes. In particular, I created a streamlined and AI-checked web page on my blogging website which enumerates every file which comprises the aforementioned karbytes and which neatly fits onto three M_DISC compact discs (which each have a storage capacity of approximately 4.7 gigabytes). The URL to that web page is as follows:

Starting at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 06_FEBRUARY_2024 and ending at at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 21_FEBRUARY_2024 (and as of the time this section was added to this note at approximately 10PM Pacific Standard Time on 06_FEBRUARY_2024), karbytes intends to make no changes to existing karbytes content (while also making as many WayBack Machine saves of karbytes content as deemed optimal and feasible by karbytes).
