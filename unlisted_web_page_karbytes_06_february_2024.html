Although I said in the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_03_february_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous journal entry</a> which I shared to my <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_social_media_posts_koep7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> profiles that I would be taking a hiatus for approximately three weeks from making any updates to either to the public karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com or else to the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com or else to any public karbytes-created GitHub repositories which are partitioned under the portion of GitHub dot Com which is allocated to the user account whose username is @karlinarayberinger (starting between the midnight on 02_FEBRUARY_2024 and midnight on 04_FEBRUARY_2024), I decided within the past 48 hours of writing this note between 6PM Pacific Standard Time and 8PM Pacific Standard Time on 06_FEBRUARY_2024 to make a few more updates to that body of (public domain) intellectual property which I refer to within that intellectual property and elsewhere as karbytes. In particular, I created a streamlined and AI-checked web page on my blogging website which enumerates every file which comprises the aforementioned karbytes and which neatly fits onto three M_DISC compact discs (which each have a storage capacity of approximately 4.7 gigabytes). The URL to that web page is as follows:
