Today karbytes registered a new GitHub account (with the username @karbytessupporter and the email address karbytesforlife@protonmail.com) and then created exactly one public repository on that account named development_space (and that GitHub repository was created by karbytes in order to host web page source code files and media files which pertain to either the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com or else to the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (and each of those two websites is freely available to the public and licensed as public domain according to "The Unlicense" LICENSE plain-text file in each public karbytes-created GitHub repository and according to the terms defined by the web page named PUBLIC_DOMAIN on the aforementioned website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) while karbytes is on some kind of hiatus such as what is described in the plain-text file whose URL is the first web address in the list of web addresses below). 

The three web addresses below the first web address in the list of web addresses below pertain to karbyets' setting up an alternative GitHub account in order to continue change logging and archiving (to the WayBack Machine at Archive dot Org) files which karbytes expects to eventually add to its public GitHub repositories under the username @karlinarayberinger and incorporate into the HTML "fabric" of any of the two aforementioned WordPress dot Com websites. 

During the aforementioned hiatus period (which is described in the aforementioned plain-text file named karbytes_03_february_2024.txt), karbytes expects to burn all official karbytes intellectual property (i.e. each zip file which is created by pressing the big green CODE button in the upper right corner of each public karbytes-created GitHub repository which is part of the GitHub user account whose username is @karlinarayberinger) onto three new blank M_DISCs which karbytes placed an Amazon dot Com order for today. Those three new discs will take the place of the collection of burned M_DISCs which is currently displayed on one of the walls of karbytes' room in Castro Valley, California. The discs which are currently hanging on that wall will be placed in the storage container which contains all other old M_DISC backups of karbytes intellectual property as described on the web page named KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack_physical_artifacts_inventory of the aforementioned website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. 

The new discs (like the three discs which currently hang on that wall of karbytes' room) will also be placed inside of clear plastic page protectors with their own respective hand-written paper slip labels such as karbytes2024A, karbytes2024B, and karbytes2024C.
