For approximately one year (especially while walking along the segment of Redwood Road which borders Redwood Canyon Golf Course on my way to and from <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_398/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ramage Peak trail</a>), I have had the following "controversial" thoughts: 

Compared to many other (apparently sentient) animals (humans included), I seem to be extremely fortunate due to the fact that I personally have never (at least not yet) experienced genuinely <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_19_january_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suicidal</a> feelings nor genuinely intolerable pain. Also, I seem to have been born in arguably the best time and place to be immersed in the things about human existence I most appreciate: accessing and augmenting the public World Wide Web, traversing and camping in mediterranean climate biomes which are idyllic in their natural beauty and iconic in their distinct geographical features (e.g. smooth and rounded looking hills dotted with oak trees and covered almost entirely by grass ranging from bright green to tawny gold-brown depending on the season), and having access to a high-speed train system which spans a large waterfront metropolitan area which are major hubs of international commerce and cultural artifact sharing. I have thought many times that I could possibly be the most fortunate human (if not sentient being in all existence).

If that is the case (i.e. that karbytes is literally the most advantaged (i.e. all-time "highest scoring") "player" of "The Game"), then I assume that is because I happen to be the subjective manifestation of God playing the most privileged creature within all of God's creation (which includes and us ultimately self creation) with knowledge of how <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_14_december_2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Law of Attraction"</a> works (and not merely as a watered down "new age" hoax or as a "spiritual materialism capitalist" gimmick, but rather, as a ubiquitous algorithmic orderliness which may or may not conform to peer-reviewed and long-standing scientific knowledge about how nature works).

As "fucked up" as this may sound to some people, I have found it personally useful to assume that what <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panpsychism</a> posits is true is actually true (i.e. that all of reality is dreamed up (i.e. hallucinated) by a ubiquitous and immortal mind). From my current vantage, I am not sure whether all imaginable phenomena exist somewhere in an all-encompassing and boundlessly large multiverse or whether only a smaller subset of that hypothetical <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse</a> actually exists. What I understand "Law of Attraction" to be is more than mere confirmation bias (though "Law of Attraction" drives the phenomenon of confirmation bias (i.e. the event of an information processing agent ignoring information which does not immediately or obviously pertain to that information processing agent's goals)). I think that God only conjures up into existence is what God actually wants to experience (and, by implication, what God can tolerate). 

I have thought extensively about how all events which appear to happen as part of some <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causal</a> chain (along a linear and unidirectional timeline) are "selected" to happen (out of a set of potentially infinite phenomenally distinct events) through what appears to be an algorithmic process of elimination (which is oftentimes quite brutal as demonstrated by the videos I have seen of animals decimating each other while competing for scarce resources which both need in order to survive and/or to generate genetic or memetic offspring). Such a brutal game of fighting over coveted and finite resources seems hellish but, if the theories I posited in this article are accurately descriptive of objective reality, then none of the players of that game are seriously suffering more than they can stand at any point in any space-time continuum.

I want to conclude this post with what I think is a useful and inspiring "trick" for optimal well-being and goal-acquisition: be non-subordinate and be unique. (I think it's impossible for me not to be each of those two things)!
