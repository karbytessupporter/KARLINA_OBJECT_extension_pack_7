I built a pyramid.

The pyramid is infinitely tall.

I am always building the next "step" of that "ladder".

The "poem" above was written by karbytes at approximately 10:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 29_JANUARY_2024.

The "poem" is meant to depict a pyramid-shaped structure whose base is rectangular and whose four triangular walls converge at a single point at the top of the prism. That point at the top represents my local vantage as an individual sentient information processing agent (or, perhaps more precisely, the particular "timeless slice" along the particular (and what appears to be solipsistic from my vantage) space-time continuum in which I observe present-moment phenomena.
