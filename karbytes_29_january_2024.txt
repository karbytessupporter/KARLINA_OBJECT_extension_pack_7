I built a pyramid.

The pyramid is infinitely tall.

I am always building the next "step" of that "ladder".

The "poem" above was written by karbytes at approximately 10:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 29_JANUARY_2024.

The "poem" is meant to depict a pyramid-shaped structure whose base is rectangular and whose four triangular walls converge at a single point at the top of the prism. 

That point at the top represents my local vantage as an individual sentient information processing agent (or, perhaps more precisely, the particular "timeless slice" along the particular (and what appears to be solipsistic from my vantage) space-time continuum in which I observe present-moment phenomena). 

The "pyramid" is mentally visualized by karbytes as growing from the top downward such that, for infinitely many karbytes' computational "cycles", a rectangular layer is augmented to the bottom of that pyramid. 

The aforementioned cone-shaped expansion metaphorically depicts my consciousness (and collection of memorized knowledge (which is physically substantiated by my original (human(oid)) organic nervous system or by some kind of external data recording media which is activated by some kind of interpreting computational device)) becoming increasingly less limited in terms of data comprehensiveness, pattern-recognition sophistication, and ability to control the physical reality I appear to myself to be inhabiting expect (or at least hope) as time elapses inside of my first-person rendering of physical (and virtual) reality.
