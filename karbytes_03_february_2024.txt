The political party I am a registered member of is the Green Party (and I am exclusively a citizen of the United States of America). 

I believe that behaviors which are revenge-driven rather than implemented purely to minimize further harm almost always lead to more revenge-driven behavior instances in a recursive manner until a "base case" is reached when a "critical mass" of "global harm" is attained (and, with it, the annihilation of many if not all people within that "global system").

After I publish this note (and beginning at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 03_FEBRUARY_2024) , I intend to not make any updates to any public karbytes-created GitHub repositories nor to any public karbytes-created web pages (and those web pages and GitHub repositories pertain exclusively to the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and to the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) until 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 21_FEBRUARY_2024.
